            javascript is going to make a web request in order to
            get access to additional data.

            So far i javascript our javascript code hav exclusively
            been running code that exist only on our computer.Its running
            inside the web browser and all happening inside the web browser.
            We are not communicating to some external service.

            What we look at now something known as 'Ajax' which is about 
            asynchronous Javascript , where the idea is even after a page has
            loaded , using javascript , we can mae additional web request to 
            asked for additional information,either from our own web servers or 
            from some third-party web servers.

            FETCH IS GOING TO MAKE A WEB REQUEST.it could be our own or someone
            else's .AND its going to get back some HTTP response from that page.
             
            and what fetch gives back to us something in Javascript known as
            Promise.

            A promise is going to be a way of representing the idea that something
            is going to come back , but it may not come back immediately.

            .then ==> it says what should i do when the promise comes back,once i get back
            something like a response.
