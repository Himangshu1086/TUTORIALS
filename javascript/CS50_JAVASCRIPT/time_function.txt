    --------------

1.) localStorage.getItem(key)

   { 
       when we would like to get something out of localStorage
    based on its key--some name that we have given to that value. 
    }

2.)localStorage.setItem(key , value)

    {
        this is used tp go ahead and adds a new value to localStorage or replace
    an existing value in localStorage setting the key equal t a particular
    value.
    }


    So we can use localStorage then to allow our web pages , using javascript
    t able to store information and retrieve information from the browser.
