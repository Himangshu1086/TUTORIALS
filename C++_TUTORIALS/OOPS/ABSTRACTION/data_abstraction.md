## Data Abstraction in C++

Data Abstraction is a process of providing only the essential details to the outside world and hiding the internal details, i.e., representing only the essential details in the program.

## Data Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:

- Abstraction using classes (use of access specifiers)
- Abstraction in header files. ( header files life math.h which contains pow() )

## Advantages Of Abstraction:

- Implementation details of the class are protected from the inadvertent user level errors.
- A programmer does not need to write the low level code.

- Data Abstraction avoids the code duplication, i.e., programmer does not have to undergo the same tasks every time to perform the similar operation.

- The main aim of the data abstraction is to reuse the code and the proper partitioning of the code across the classes.

- Internal implementation can be changed without affecting the user level code.
