/*
WHAT IS INSTANCE IN C++ ?
Sol = An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.


Object  =  any entity that has state and behavior is known
as an object. it can be physical amd logical

Class = collection of objects.it is a logical entity.

Inheritance  
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours
of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. 
It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

Polymorphism 
When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. 
For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g.
shape or rectangle etc.In C++, we use Function overloading 
and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Abstraction 
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

Encapsulation  
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is
known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

1 What is a class?

A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint,
 which contains some values, known as member data or member, and 
 some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions. 
 So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions
that are defined in the class.
Therefore the class is basically a template or blueprint for objects. 
Also one can create as many objects as they want based on a class.


10. What is an object?
An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains 
the instance of the members and behaviors defined in the class template. 
In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, 
whereas class is just the blueprint for that object. 
So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behavior.
